*“A sprouting idea comes alive through a website!”* is the newfound proverb in a techno-savvy world like today. Keeping up this drift, the Indore Institute of Science & Technology (IIST) conducted a Web Design🧑🏻‍💻Competition, **DESIGNO 🎨**. The objective was to adopt innovative pedagogy with project-based learning and promote upskilling among engineering scholars to pave the way for employability. Our task was to build the Institute and Computer Science landing web page, the way we would have dreamt.

Our hard work paid off and our team won Designo with flying 🌈colors securing the 🥇 first position among all the teams that participated along with a cash prize of 💰 Rs. 9000.
